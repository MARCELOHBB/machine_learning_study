## :point_right: Project


 project aimed at studying and learning the technologies used in machine learning with the python language. Files covering sklearn classification, unsupervised algorithms, natural language (NLP), deeplearning, model validation, model optimization through hyperparameters and optimization with random exploration will be developed. This teaching is based on the Alura teaching platform.
 
 
 ## :pushpin: Tips
 
 
 This project was developed in VScode, if you use the same IDE, run the program in Python Interactive Window to view the graphics.
